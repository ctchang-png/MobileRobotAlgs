      <div class="helptext"><pre><!--helptext --> <span class="helptopic">simDiffSteer</span> Simulates a differential steer robot. 
 
    Renamed from earlier "simRobot" because the entire simulator
    contains this class solely for the purpose of motion simulation.
 
    Accepts left and right wheel commands or encoder readings for a
    differentially steered robot and integrates them with respect to
    time in the plane. Produces a pose estimate of the form [x y th].
 
    Independently from the nature of time that is used, the class can
    be used for estimation if you drive it with encoder readings or for
    predictive control if you drive it with commands.
 
    It actually makes sense to have up to three independent instances
    of this class - for reference trajectories, estimated trajectories,
    and simulation but it makes no sense to use one instance for any
    two or more more simultaneously.
 
    Like almost any motion simulator, this class models the velocity
    kinematics of the platform, and it converts from commanded or
    sensed wheel velocities or distances to the resulting position and
    orientation by integrating a nonlinear underactuated kinematic
    differential equation. That is the easy part and it takes just a
    few lines of code.
 
    A key design feature is accurate simulation of a fixed delay
    between the sending of commands to the robot and the resulting
    action. In the case where this object is driven by commands,
    they are placed in a FIFO implemented as a sliding vector so
    that an (interpolated and) delayed command is the one being
    simulated. Commands are assumed to arrive with monotone time tags
    and it is only possible to query the latest state. In effect, when
    driven by commands, this object simulates the data at RECIEVE TIME
    and the latest commands provided are treated as not having arrived
    yet. This interpolated FIFO business is an attempt to do this right
    because the problem requires you to deal with the fact that the
    delay is almost never an integer number of cycles of this
    simulator. Therefore, in addition to using a FIFO to model the
    delays, the FIFO has to be interpolated when the delayed time
    queried falls between two historical samples.
 
    This class can be configured to work in "real time" (from the
    processor clock) or to work from "supplied time" - time tags on
    commands or sensor data; you choose which when the object is turned
    on and you have to stick with that choice afterwards. This is a
    design feature to prevent mixing up time sources (which cannot ever
    be correct). 
 
    This feature matters because a) the clock on a remote robot is not
    even close to synchronized with the one used to run this object and
    b) even if it was, the delays and sampling of the signals going
    back and forth would make it irrelevant even if they were
    synchronized. The most accurate way to process incoming encoder
    data is to use the time tags produced on the robot but the most
    accurate way to model output command latency is to use the clock on
    this computer. Further complicating things is the fact that
    simulation takes significant processing so using a simulator slows
    down your controller algorithn and changes its real time
    performance for the worse. All of that adds up to it being best for
    this simulation purpose to use a) encoder time tags for state
    estimation and b) supplied time from a suspendable clock for
    processing commands. Neither of those is "real" in the sense of
    reading the actual clock on this computer but that option remains
    here so you can try it yourself.
 
    As complicated as all that is, it makes controlling a simulated
    robot pretty close to the real thing from a timing point of view.
    All of that discussion is about how this simulator works. In your
    own control code, use real time (tic and toc) or robotIF.toc when
    controlling a real robot and ask the parent simulator of this
    object for the time on the suspendable clock when controlling the
    simulator.
 
    Logging a dedicated number of samples of pose, command, and time is
    built-in for convenience if enabled in the constructor. This can be
    useful for producing plots to debug your code or to debug this
    class. As of now (May 2020) delayed velocity is interpolated at the
    encoder (state update) rate and this means the simulated robot will
    come to a stop tDelay seconds after the first zero command is
    issued.
 
    This class is implemented to support concurrent programming despite
    MATLABs scant facilities to support it. In the absence of a test
    and set facility in MATLAB to implement a semaphone, the design
    performs all FIFO processing inside the call to updateState() and
    its descendants. That function is intended to tolerate being called
    inside a timer interrupt service routine (ISR) which is configured
    so that it runs to completion and cannot interrupt itself. The most
    "critical" code sections are those that update the FIFOs and shift
    the data. All three of the FIFOs for (vl,vr,t) must be in a
    consistent state and not in the middle of shifting when they are
    queried by the interp1 function. To ensure this, commands are
    placed in holding variables "lastvr" etc. by the user thread and
    then moved to the FIFOs in the ISR thread. A dozen other designs
    were tried and all did not avoid deadlock and/or inconsistent
    accesses. Of course, the holding variables could be queried in an
    inconsistent state too but in that case we are talking about smooth
    time signals rather than shifting data in memory, so the effects
    will be tolerable.
 
    Due to the nondeterministic behavior of concurrent threads, you
    should not change that aspect of this class lightly. It was a
    painful process to get where we are. Note that adding printfs to
    debug it can change or eliminate the timing issues that caused the
    bug you are trying to find. Despite all that emphasis on
    concurrency, you do not have to use this class with two different
    threads. It is perfectly fine to send it commands or encoders using
    real or provided time and query state.
 
    Because we are integrating a nonlinear DE here, it is a basic
    assumption that state updates are requested fast enough to reduce
    integration error to tolerable levels. There is no required update
    rate for commands though. You can send it just one and integrate it
    forever.
 
    In the case of real-time, it is critical that you fire up the
    instance right before (and not "some time" before) you start
    feeding it commands or sensor readings. This makes the delays and
    time derivatives work correctly.  This 2020 update has also removed
    the need to "fire_up" this object externally in order to reduce the
    burden on the user. You can still do it but if you do not, it will
    be done when the first command or encoder frame comes in. Again,
    this last minute (microsecond?) fire up is important for delays and
    time derivatives to work correctly and it is a key pragma for
    tolerating MATLABs delayed parsing techniques. MATLAB was never
    intended to be real time so we merely do our best anyway.
 
    Attempting to read past the FIFO on either end will now return the
    first or last element as appropriate. This feature should prevent
    MATLABs interp1 from ever returning a NaN -- which used to be a
    signficant failure mode.
 
    Error models are used to corrupt both encoder data and outgoing
    commands by amounts that are peculiar to each robot id.
